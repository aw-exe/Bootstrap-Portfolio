    <h3>About Me</h3>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6">

                    <p>My name is Ashton and I'm currently a student enrolled at UT Austin's full stack developer program. I got interested in coding from my current job working in home automation and from watching too many sci-fi movies. My areas of interest in the tech world include machine learning, AI, virtual reality and cyber security. I'm excited to start my coding journey and learn as much as I can over the next six months.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I'm a Houston native, but lived in Dallas while I obtained my bachelors in psychology. I've worked in a few different industries, but I currently work as a service manager at Custom Audio Video located in Bellaire where we specialize in home automation systems. Whenever Iâ€™m not working or practicing coding I enjoy spending time with my mother, going to concerts with my friends, practicing yoga and watching sci-fi and horror movies.</p>
